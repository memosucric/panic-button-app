# Overview

The Agile Execution App (AXA) enables karpatkey’s asset managers to safely and rapidly deploy, adjust or exit any position with carefully tailored and predesigned strategies.

## Key Objectives / Benefits

1. **Independence from Vulnerable User Interfaces (UIs):** By shifting operations to our Agile Execution App, asset managers can mitigate the risks associated with UI vulnerabilities, hacks, or malfunctioning interfaces, such as in the case of Safe's UI outage.
2. **Enhanced Clarity and Preparedness during Emergencies:** The app provides a centralized platform for operations, allowing team members to access a comprehensive list of available actions, even in critical situations. This clarity fosters a level-headed approach in handling emergencies, ensuring swift decision-making.
3. **Minimized Human Error:** Utilizing the app minimizes the likelihood of human error in executing tasks, particularly in complex strategies. With various strategies readily available within the app's menu, operational mishaps are significantly reduced both in routine tasks and during crisis scenarios.
4. **Time Savings and Operational Efficiency:** The app streamlines repetitive tasks, improving the overall operational efficiency of various processes. The app helps AMs save time and opportunity costs by allowing them to focus on tasks that require human judgment and creativity, thus maximizing the value of their time and expertise.
5. **Dual-Layer Security Measures:** The app ensures a high level of security by implementing dual-layer security measures. Firstly, preset filters act as an initial security check, followed by the execution of predesigned strategies within the app. This layered approach significantly reduces the risk of critical errors occurring due to faulty executions.

## Key Assumptions

- Protocols’ interfaces may not be available or may be malfunctioning during an emergency.
- Asset managers that need to design the right strategy during the pressure of a risk scenario may not come up with the optimum course of action, or could even execute flawed transactions.
- The design and execution of the proper strategy takes valuable time and this can generate losses in the DAO’s funds.
- AMs carry out repetitive tasks in order to execute a batch of transactions.
