## Getting Started

TODO: Complete

## About

This project exists to make it easier for the treasury management team to manage positions.  
Contributions to improve this project are welcome.

## How to use

To get started, just clone the repository and run `yarn install && yarn dev`:

    git clone git@github.com:KarpatkeyDAO/panic-button-app.git
    yarn install
    yarn dev

## Building and deploying in production

If you wanted to run this site in production, you should install modules then build the site with `yarn build` and run it with `yarn start`:

    yarn install
    yarn build
    yarn start

You should run `yarn build` again any time you make changes to the site.

Note: If you are already running a webserver on port 80 (e.g. Macs usually have the Apache webserver running on port 80) you can still start the example in production mode by passing a different port as an Environment Variable when starting (e.g. `PORT=3000 yarn start`).

## Configuring

If you configure a .env file (just copy [.env.example](https://github.com/KarpatkeyDAO/panic-button-app/blob/develop/.env.example) over to '.env' and fill in the options) you can configure a range of options.
We also have to configure the file of the strategies to be used.
